## Notes

I'd like to implement a standard on the format based on this at some point.
The next bit is an example of how the file should appear. I don't claim
to support the standard until I have reviewed it.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
